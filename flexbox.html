                    Computer science, the study of computers and computing, including their theoretical and algorithmic
                    foundations, hardware and software, and their uses for processing information. The discipline of
                    computer science includes the study of algorithms and data structures, computer and network design,
                    modeling data and information processes, and artificial intelligence. Computer science draws some of
                    its foundations from mathematics and engineering and therefore incorporates techniques from areas
                    such as queueing theory, probability and statistics, and electronic circuit design. Computer science
                    also makes heavy use of hypothesis testing and experimentation during the conceptualization, design,
                    measurement, and refinement of new algorithms, information structures, and computer architectures.

                    Computer science is considered as part of a family of five separate yet interrelated disciplines:
                    computer engineering, computer science, information systems, information technology, and software
                    engineering. This family has come to be known collectively as the discipline of computing. These
                    five disciplines are interrelated in the sense that computing is their object of study, but they are
                    separate since each has its own research perspective and curricular focus. (Since 1991 the
                    Association for Computing Machinery [ACM], the IEEE Computer Society [IEEE-CS], and the Association
                    for Information Systems [AIS] have collaborated to develop and update the taxonomy of these five
                    interrelated disciplines and the guidelines that educational institutions worldwide use for their
                    undergraduate, graduate, and research programs.)
